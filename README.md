# Contact List Application

This is a simple Android application built with Jetpack Compose that fetches and displays a list of contacts from the user's device. It showcases contact names, phone numbers, and contact photos (if available). The application requests the user's permission to access contacts and displays an appropriate message if permission is denied or no contacts are found.

## Features

- Displays the contact name, phone number, and photo in a `LazyColumn` list.
- Requests the `READ_CONTACTS` permission at runtime.
- Shows a placeholder image if the contact does not have a photo.
- Handles the case where no contacts are found or permission is denied.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Android Studio Arctic Fox (or higher)
- Android device or emulator with Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher
- Internet access (if using Coil to load contact images)
  
## Permissions

This application requires the following permissions:
- `READ_CONTACTS`: To access and display contacts from the user's device.

The permission is requested at runtime when the application starts. If the permission is not granted, the app will not display contacts and will show an appropriate message.

- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - For loading contact images from URIs.
- [Android ContactsContract](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract) - To query the user's contacts.
